## 2023 NYC Restaurant Inspection Analysis

Every year restaurants in NYC are subject to inspections at the hands of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). They are required to adhere to food safety standards and each infraction costs them points that add up to their inspection score. I conducted this analysis from a dataset obtained from NYC Open Data to determine if there is any correlation between inspection score and boro or cuisine. My analysis incorporated advanced Python techniques, such as linear regression, K-means clustering, and geospatial analysis.
